# Library-Management-System
Marla Peraza Ravelo, CEN-3024C-24204, 1/26/2025. This is a project that I created for class CEN-3024C (Software Development I) at Valencia College to apply knowledge about the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process using Java programming language.
The objective of this project was to plan, design, and develop a console program which would provide a library with a  Library Management System (LMS) that fulfills basic needs like adding, removing, and querying information from a list of patrons. The program helps the librarians add, remove, and query patrons easily. The user will be presented with a text menu that provides the choices he or she can make in the system, and the user will input a number representing that choice. For the first choice (adding patrons from a file), the user will be also prompted to enter the path from a file that contains the information of patrons previously formatted, and this information is printed on the screen. For the second choice, the user will enter the datails of each patron manually as per each prompt he or she receives. For the third choice, the user will input a 7-digit id number and the patron with that corresponding number in the program will be deleted. For the fourth choice, all the patrons inside the system will be displayed. For the fifth choice, the program will exit.
